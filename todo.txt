Foreplay

Preliminary instructions:
The subject allows the use of a micro-framework, and only that. If material used by the student (if applicable) is not in the list of suggestions of the subject, check that it is indeed a micro-
framework according to the definition of the subject. As a reminder:
> We will consider that a "micro-framework" has a router, and possibly some templating. but no ORM, validators or user account management.
If the tool used is not a micro-framework, the support stops
Also, if during the defence there is only one warning, error or notice in the web console, select Crash at the top of the page.
An error code of 500 to 599 is also considered a Crash.

Security:
The subject insisted on this point : the site must be secure. At least make sure that :
the passwords are encrypted in the DATABASE
- input and upload forms have corrected validations
no SQL injection possible
If only one of these points is not valid, the defence stops.


Features

User account management:
A user must be able to register, providing at least email address, username, surname, first name and password (secure, a common French word that anyone should not be
accepted, for example).
A connected user must be able to fill in an extended profile, and must be able to change this information, as well as the information provided when registering, at any time.

User connection:
The user must be able to log in with his credentials, and must be able to receive a password reset email in case of oversight.
The disconnection must be possible from any page of the site.

Consultation:
The user must be able to consult the people who have consulted his profile (there must therefore be a history of visits to the profile, as well as the people who have "liked"him.

Popularity Score:
Each user must have a Popularity score. Ask the student to explain his strategy to calculate this score, it must be consistent and minimally relevant.

Geolocation:
The user must be geolocated to the nearest district. Sir user does not want to be geolocated, strategies must be put in place to make it happen.
The user must be able to modify his localization on his profile.

Proposed profiles:
The user should be able to easily find, when logging in, a list of profile suggestions.
Relevant profiles should be provided to the user, corresponding to his / her sexuality. If the user does not inform his sexuality, he will be considered bisexual.
Check with the student that the profile proposals are weighted according to three criteria:
- same geographical area as user
- maximum of common tags of interest
- maximum popularity
Ask the student to explain their strategy to post a list of relevant suggestions.

Research:
The user must be able to perform an advanced search by selecting one or more criteria such as :
- age range
- Popularity score interval
- location
- one or more tags of interest

Sorts and filters:
The list of profile proposals, as well as the search results, must be triable and filterable by:
- Age
- location
- popularity
- tag

Other users:
The public profile of a user must include all the information he has provided, apart from his email address and password.
I must also include its popularity score, and its connection status - if the user appears disconnected, we must see the date of his last visit.

Connection between users:
A user may like, not like, another user's profile. When two users "compare", they are said to be connected : they can then engage in conversation.
A user who does not have a photo should not be able to link the profile of another user.
Another user's profile should clearly indicate whether it is connected to the current user or whether it" likes " the current user.

like <3      <3
liked   <3   <3
connected <3 <3

Postponement and blocking:
You can flag a profile as a "fake account", and block a given user. A blocked user must no longer appear in the search results (or suggestions), and must no longer
generate notifications.

Chat:
Two connected users can chat in real time (10 seconds).
The user must be able to see from any page that they received a message.

Notification:
In addition, a user must be informed, in real time (a margin of 10 seconds is allowed), of the following events:
- a "like" in his profile
- someone visited his profile
- a user "like” has "like” in return
- a logged-in user no longer “likes”the current user
It must be able to see from any page that a notification has not been read.
